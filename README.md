MSR Tailors and Fashion Management System primarily focuses on streamlining operations for customers seeking clothes. This web-based application offers a set of features, including inquiry management, user management, product management, rental product order placement and management, order placement management (purchasing products), employee management, order and rental management, and inventory management. By utilizing this web-based application, stakeholders can efficiently manage their tasks.


Customer:
The workflow commences with a user registering in the system by providing their valid details. After successful account creation, users can sign in using their valid login credentials such as email address and password, with the system validating these credentials to ensure accuracy. Once logged in, users have options to edit their profile, change their password, or delete their profile if necessary. They can browse rental clothes like suits and purchase clothes such as suits, trousers, shirts, and accessories. Upon selecting suitable clothing, users proceed to make payments using the payment method of their choice. They can also track their order status and anticipate the delivery date. Selection of suitable clothes falls into two categories: rental clothing and purchasing clothing. If users select purchasing clothes, they have the option to customize their chosen items such as shirts, suits, and trousers. Additionally, users can send inquiries to the administration by filling the inquiry sections. If users need clarification on any details, they can chat with the MSR AI assistant. Upon inquiry submission, the administration will reach out to them via their provided email address.

Employee:
Employees register in the system by providing their valid details. Upon successful account creation, they can sign in using their valid login credentials such as employee ID and password, with the system validating these credentials. After signing in, employees are directed to the employee section, where they have options to edit their profile and change their password. They can also apply for leave by providing valid reasons, check the status of their leave applications, and delete leave applications if necessary. Additionally, employees can check the availability of clothing materials and request restocking if needed.

Administration/Admin:
As an administrator, individuals can log in using their email address and password. Administrators have options to view inquiry counts and order counts, as well as check inventories. If there are notifications regarding requested materials, administrators can restock the necessary items based on current stock levels. Administrators can also reply to inquiries, with responses sent to the relevant customer's account. They can add products to rental and purchasing sections, and with voice recognition, they can direct to those pages. Furthermore, administrators can process manual orders for in-store customers by filling out the necessary details. They can manage rentals and accept or reject employee leave requests. Additionally, administrators can add further employee details for those who might work in the store. Employees will receive an ID assigned by the administration. Furthermore, administrators have the ability to edit, delete, and generate reports for all system functionalities.

In summary, the customer workflow begins with registration, granting access to account features like profile editing and browsing and purchasing clothing items. Customers can track orders, customize purchases, and contact administration for inquiries. Employees register and access profile management tools, including leave applications and inventory monitoring. Administrators oversee the system, managing inquiries, orders, and inventory, as well as facilitating communication between customers and employees. They can process manual orders, manage rentals, and approve employee leave requests while maintaining comprehensive control over system functionalities, including editing, deleting, and generating reports.
